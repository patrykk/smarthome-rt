  The VL53L1X is the latest Time Of Flight (ToF) sensor to be released. It uses
  a VCSEL (vertical cavity surface emitting laser) to emit a class 1 IR laser
  and time the reflection to the target. What does all this mean? You can measure
  the distance to an object up to 4 meters away with millimeter resolution!

  Weâ€™ve found the precision of the sensor to be 1mm but the accuracy is around +/-5mm.

  This library handles the initialization of the VL53L1X and is able to query the sensor
  for different readings.

  Because ST has chosen not to release a complete datasheet we are forced to reverse
  engineer the interface from their example code and I2C data stream captures.
  For ST's reference code see STSW-IMG007

  The device operates as a normal I2C device. There are *many* registers. Reading and 
  writing happens with a 16-bit address. The VL53L1X auto-increments the memory
  pointer with each read or write.

  Development environment specifics:
  Arduino IDE 1.8.5
